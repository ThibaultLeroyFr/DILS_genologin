Here I provide the code to randomly pick up some 100kb genomic sequences and automatically generate the input files for DILS.
(my fasta sequences are on the genotoul cluster, with the following format  /work/genphyse/cytogen/Thibault/SeqApiPop_completevcf/Species/reconstr_speces_chrXXX.bed.tmp/*.fasta )
