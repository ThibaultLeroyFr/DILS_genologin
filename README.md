# DILS_genologin
For details regarding DILS, please see: <br>
https://github.com/popgenomics/DILS<br>

Here, the repository only explains how to use the software DILS on the genologin computing cluster (genotoul)<br>

## Launch DILS on the example dataset
Data from the example dataset: https://github.com/popgenomics/DILS/tree/master/example <br>
The script_lanceur_DILS_test.sh is used to launch the script on the genologin cluster.<br>
Edit the path in the bidon.yaml to the data and where the DILS scripts are on the cluster.<br><br>
Then launch the computation:<br>
sbatch script_lanceur_DILS_test.sh<br>

## Modifications to do to adjust to your own environment
Take care of all the dependencies regarding python2 and R !! Everything work well on the R version R-4.1.2_gcc-9.3.0, but before I tried several other R versions currently installed on the cluster and I experienced different problems regarding the R librairy dependencies (oen perhaps associated with this reported issue: https://groups.google.com/g/dils---demographic-inferences-with-linked-selection/c/mMBJjj79LoQ, not sure). Anyway, it is expected to work if you load the module associated to the version R-4.1.2_gcc-9.3.0, see script_lanceur_DILS_test.sh.<br><br>
Change "binpath =" in the snakemake files (./DILS/bin/) e.g. ./DILS/bin/Snakefile_2pop <br><br>
Currently I used the lightMode, but I should probably switch to the normal mode to really benefit from the HTC cluster.<br><br>
Use my modified version of the R scripts that require the abcrf function (e.g. model_comp_2pop_allModels.R, for details, see discussion in https://groups.google.com/g/dils---demographic-inferences-with-linked-selection/c/Qcu3rqvPXWc )<br>

## Exclude some specific nodes (slurm)
To exclude nodes that lead to jobs stuck running on these nodes (e.g. node129 recently), it is possible to use the function: <br>
"#SBATCH --exclude=node129" <br>
To exclude more nodes:<br>
"#SBATCH --exclude=node127,node128,node129,node130,node131,node132,node133,node134,node135,node136" or directly "#SBATCH --exclude=node[127-136]"<br>
But this also requires to adjust the script that launch the snakemake and the associated json file (see script_lanceur2_DILS.sh & cluster2.json) <br>

## Generate the input files for DILS (see ./generate_inputfiles/)
The script script_generate_inputfiles_DILS.sh helps to generate the input files for DILS on my own data. The script will select a given number of genomic regions and then change the header in order to obtain the following format (>locusID|pop|ind|Allele1). Note that here, the sequences data only contain Allele1 since the individuals are haploid (note that there is no problem to use haploid data in DILS, see Fra√Øsse et al. 2021). Thanks to this script, a directory is created, containing the sequence data, the yaml and json files, as well as the script to run DILS (script_lanceur_DILS.sh, see above). The script is just provided as an example on my own data! <br><br>
For my own work, only the first lines of the script should be modified: <br>
Species1=$(echo "Species1") #Define the name of the species1 <br>
Species2=$(echo "Species2") #Define the name of the species2 <br>
nbloci=$(echo "200" | bc) # Define the number of loci to randomly select <br>
constant_or_variable_Ne_through_time=$(echo "constant") #Define if DILS should run simulations assuming constant or variable Ne through time (constant/variable) <br>
 use_the_SFS=$(echo "no") # Define if DILS should consider the site frequency spectrum (yes/no) <br> <br>

Then to launch the script to generate the input files: sbatch script_lanceur_generate_inputfiles_DILS.sh <br>
